# Operations Manual/Leadership README for Robert Rees

Inspired by Michael Lopp, Pat Berry, and Ed Rose

## Core beliefs in a nutshell

As a leader, I believe that my first job is to hold doors open and enable you.  This means that if you, for any reason, are feeling like you're facing anything preventing you from doing your best work, speak up and let me know.  This also means that I am relatively hands-off - you were hired for a good reason, and I trust that you're going to do your best and that you'll flag me down if something comes up.

I also believe in being as transparent as possible.  Though there are sometimes laws and policies that prevent me from divulging information, I am an otherwise completely open book.

Finally, I believe that diverse teams produce the best results.  To quote Mike Monteiro: "I mean, you don’t build a good baseball team by piling up 25 great shortstops."

## My answers to [first 1:1 questions](https://larahogan.me/blog/first-one-on-one-questions/)

**What makes you grumpy?**

Broadly, dishonesty.  If you aren't comfortable telling me something, that is 100% fine  But do not misrepresent the truth to me or about me.  I also include omission of information as a form of dishonesty - I cannot act on what I don't know.

Also, that thing where you bend over to pick something up but keep not actually grabbing it and so you keep retrying but keep missing it.  Oh, I'm the only one?  Cool...

**How will I know when you’re grumpy?**

I can be unintentionally terse.  It's a really bad habit and I am working on resolving it.  Know, however, that if I'm grumpy over something you've done, I will tell you.  I generally get mad at situations, not people.

**How can I help you when you’re grumpy?**

Generally, I just need a little time.  Let me rant it out (preferably over a drink) and I'm good to go.

**How do you like feedback - the medium (IRC, email, in person, etc.)**

Anything and everything!  I feel that the gravity of the feedback warrants different feedback mechanisms.  Gonna drop a bomb on me?  Let's meet face-to-face (Zoom is usually close enough).  Just wanting to drop a note?  Chat and email are totally fine.

**How do you like feedback - routine like in 1:1s, or as-it-happens**

Again, depends!  If I really screwed something up and I need to fix something now, let me know ASAP.  Otherwise, whatever you're comfortable with.  I'm flexible.

**How do you prefer to receive recognition? (public or private)**

Public, partially so I have a chance to thank you in front of your peers!

**What makes 1:1s the most valuable for you?**

They're your time with me - I think their consistency is vital.  It means we actively talk at least once a week and gives us a chance to check in and catch any potential problems.  I find them almost sacred and do everything I can to make sure they happen.

**What are your goals for this year? And for the next 3 months?**

This quarter I want to really clean up and streamline our SDLC (software development life cycle) - my annual goals are all about knowing how much time things take and optimizing them.

For the calendar year, I want to keep improving as a manager, especially for remote employees, for what I think are obvious reasons.

**What do you need from your manager?**

Context and direction.  Also encouragement and cheerleading.  Not necessarily in that order though.

**From your team?**

Communication and transparency.  Don't be afraid to lean on each other when need be.

**From your peers? (outside the team)**

Know that I'm speaking from experience and have a lot of context on things that you might not.

**What’s your favorite baked good?**

Chocolate chip cookies.  Hands down.  I once spent about a month trying to get the right recipe and got very close to the perfect cookie.

## Other random tidbits

- I like to nerd out on things.  Whiskey, bags, music, guitars and guitar gear.  I like to dive deep and fully immerse myself in subjects and learn as much as I can.
- Right now, my playsts include The Band Royale, Gary Clark Jr., Philip Sayce, Jimmie Vaughan, and Stevie Ray Vaughan (always SRV).  Other stuff comes and goes, as well.
